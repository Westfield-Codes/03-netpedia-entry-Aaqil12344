    <h1>Chrome vs Firefox</h1>
    <p>If you’re set on using the leading web browser, <em>Google Chrome</em> is the clear choice. <strong>If you prefer to place your trust in open source features and you mistrust Google’s monopoly</strong>, </em>Mozilla Firefox is an excellent alternative. Neither of the two browsers is necessarily better. Professionals often install and use both.
      Both browsers have so many features it would be nearly impossible to utilize them all.</p>
      <p> Each browser has its own app store with a library of add-ons if you want to integrate extensions or add missing functionality. One especially useful function in <em>Firefox</em> is the Screenshot feature, which lets you capture the visible screen, part of a page or an entire web page and save it as an image file. The Reader View in <em>Firefox</em> is also noteworthy. This feature allows you to open a clutter-free view of a web page, hiding all content not related to the main article.
